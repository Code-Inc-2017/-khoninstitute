                <span>Q. </span><b>How long am I contagious when I have the flu or a cold?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>As long as you have symptoms. Your ability to spread these viruses remains until the last sniffle, and you're contagious 24 hours before you first show symptoms.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Are the new birth control pills that eliminate your periods really safe?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Yes. There's no evidence that suppressing your period is dangerous. The periods you get on the regular Pill aren't real anyway, because the hormones prevent your uterus from building up the thick lining that's normally shed during menstruation. One reason the Pill's inventors included the off week was to mimic the normal menstrual cycle in the hope that the Pope might bless the Pill. Needless to say, he didn't.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Will staring at a computer all day make me blind?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>No. A marathon computer session is like a long hike. "If you walk long enough, your legs will be tired, but that doesn't mean you've permanently damaged them,". Focusing on a computer screen—a fixed distance—will leave your eye muscles tired and stiff, plus you tend to blink less. The antidote: Look up from the computer screen every so often and focus on something 20 or more feet away, then blink briskly four or five times.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Can I get pregnant if I have sex without penetration?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Yes, although the risk of getting pregnant in this way is very low. If you want to avoid getting pregnant, you should use contraception.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>What if I didn’t have sex?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>It’s possible for you to get pregnant without having sexual intercourse if, for example:<br>
                    •	sperm get into your vagina – for example, if you or your partner have semen or pre-ejaculate on your fingers and touch your vagina<br>
                    •	your partner ejaculates near your vagina<br>
                    •	your partner’s erect penis comes into contact with your body near your vagina<br>
                The risk of getting pregnant in this way is very low because sperm can only live for a short time outside of the body. However, if you’re not planning a pregnancy, it’s important to know that it’s possible to get pregnant in this way.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>When will my periods start again after pregnancy?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>If you bottle feed your baby, or combine bottle feeding with breastfeeding, your first period could start as soon as five to six weeks after you give birth.
                If you fully breastfeed and do not combine bottle feeding with breastfeeding, it is possible that your periods may not start again until you stop breastfeeding. This is your body's way of preventing additional pregnancies while you have a small baby.
                <br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Is liposuction worth it?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Yes—but only to resculpt stubborn bulges after weight loss. It won't get rid of cellulite, and it's a bust for keeping you slim: In one study from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 43 percent of people who'd had lipo put the fat back on, mostly because they didn't adopt a healthy diet or exercise.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Is there any surefire way to stave off Alzheimer's disease?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Sadly, no. The closest scientists have come was a vaccine against synapse-destroying beta-amyloid deposits, a hallmark of the disease. But human trials were stopped abruptly a few years ago when some volunteers developed severe brain inflammation. Still, studies suggest that you can take steps to help your brain—from staying intellectually, socially, and physically active (exercise raises levels of a brain chemical called BDNF that encourages the growth of new brain cells) to eating more fruit, veggies, and salmon.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Is there an increased risk of migraine for women who choose to take estrogen for menopausal symptoms?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Yes, possibly. Women with a history of migraine who take estrogen (i.e. birth control pills or hormone therapy) may experience a worsening of their migraine. Headache can be one of the more common side effects from estrogen containing medications.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Can you get an STI from oral sex if one person has a fever blister? Also, if a person has an STI, is oral sex still OK?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Yes. STIs [sexually transmitted infections], including herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hepatitis may be transmitted orally during oral/anal sex. If there are blisters, ulcers, or any lesions present, you should abstain from this activity.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>I am trying to eat a vegetarian diet. How can I get the protein that I need?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>It is good that you are concerned because many people who start eating a vegetarian diet simply eliminate the meat from their diet and compromise their protein needs. Rich protein sources include lentils, legumes, nuts/seeds, soy products (such as tofu or soy meat substitutes), eggs, and dairy products. You need to be intentional about consuming these foods several times throughout the day.<br>
                <br><span>Q. </span><b>Does day care, preschool, etc. have an effect on children developing allergies or asthma?</b><br>
                <span>A. </span>Yes, it does. Most children in day care or preschool settings experience more viral respiratory infections in the first two to three years of life than children who are at home with no siblings. If you control for genetic background and environmental triggers, however, the children who attended day care/preschool had a lower incidence of asthma later in life.<br>
